# Apprenticeship Patterns - Dave Hoover & Adewale Oshineye

## Overview
*Apprenticeship Patterns* purports to be a kind of zen manual for craftsmen and craftswomen starting out on the road of software development mastery. It offers a conceptual overview of what apprenticeships used to be as well as what they might mean now. The book moves quickly into a pattern (a book about patterns uses patterns, go figure) of articulating problems that will likely arise in your career as a developer. For each problem, they offer a pattern to help you overcome that. Each pattern is given a memorable name that more or less helps you take it with you ("Draw Your Own Map", "The Long Road", "Breakable Toys", etc.) The patterns move from introductory (i.e. just getting started) to sustainable (the kinds of things that keep your fresh and interested years into your career). The most important supposition of the book comes in the conclusion, though: there are no true masters and we're all always apprenticing ourselves. In that sense, the books exceed the expectation of just being a book for beginners. It's a manual for the whole journey.

## My Experience of the book
### Wrong Expectation
To be honest, the book isn't what I thought it was (did I not read any reviews or descriptions? Apparently not). I was hoping it was a book about how other companies ran apprentice programs, but as I stated above it's a book about being an apprentice. I'm glad I got past that initial shock, because I found it valuable even two years after my formal apprenticeship ended.
### Formulas, Patterns, and Wisdom
As a readers who trends towards ambiguity and mysteries as sources of meaning, I tend to think that overly formulaic books (especially ones that depend on patterns to deliver their message) are trite and usually contrived. However, I did find that the meat of what Dave and Ade wrote about to be really substantive and packed with wisdom (often times wisdom beyond the domain of software development). As such, the books evades the shallowness of typical forumla-oriented books, and here the pattern and formula offer easier access to the real substance of the book.
### Memorable Quotes

> Apprenticeship is the beginning of your journey as a software craftsman. During this time you will be primarily focused inward, intent on growing your craftsmanship. While you will benefit from the attention of your peers and more experienced developers, *you must learn to grow yourself, to learn how to learn*. This focus on yourself and your need to grow it the essence of what it means to be an apprentice.
p.6 (emphasis mine)

> Despite the many benefits of a community of like-minded folk, you must also be aware of group-think. Force yourself to retain the capacity to ask questions that shock your community. Try to use that little bit of intellectual distance to generate the kind of respectful dissent that will keep your community healthy.
p. 65

---

> Humility is one of the foundations of a successful apprenticeship. Combined with ambition, humility will help keep you focused and progressing in the right direction. Without it, you're susceptible to prematurely declaring your apprenticeship complete and missing out on some important lessons.
p.71

> Mastery isn't something that a person can claim for herself, as human vanity puts a limit on how accurate our self-assessment can be.
p.116
